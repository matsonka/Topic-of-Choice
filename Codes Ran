First I need to download my genomes
  
  For my Neisseria meningitidis
  I went to the ENA website and found my data set and downloaded (bulk download files) the fastq files for my raw reads https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB9481
  
  Then after everything is downloaded I used WinSCP to move my folders (one for Nisseria and one for Moraxella of all of my raw reads into my scratch folder so that I can use it on the command line
  
  I was running out of room in my scratch folder so I used WinSCP to move everything to Dr.Techtmann's lab's server
  


Next I need to perform fastqc
performed fastqc for quality control on my raw reads
for example: fastqc ERR1124353_1.fastq.gz
I randomly selected just a few of my reads to look at the fastqc-did this for a select few of my reads for both the Nisseria and Moraxella reads


I didn't do quality trimming with cutadapt for all of my reads because from looking at the fastqc of my raw reads that I looked at I saw the reads are of good quality


aligned my reads using bowtie2
