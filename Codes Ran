First I need to download my genomes
  
  For my Neisseria meningitidis
  I went to the ENA website and found my data set and downloaded (bulk download files) the fastq files for my raw reads https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB9481
  
  Then after everything is downloaded I used WinSCP to move my folder of all of my raw reads into my scratch folder so that I can use it on the command line
  
  
Next I need to perform fastqc
try renaming everything so it'll be like 1, 2, 3, since you have to do fastqc on everysince read (did not do this)

performed fastqc
for example: fastqc ERR1124353_1.fastq.gz
did this for all of my reads for both the Nisseria and Moraxella reads

then I won't do any quality trimming with cutadapt because the reads are of good quality, select random numbers to do fast qc with



ERR1124367_2.fastq.gz had an x but it looked like it downloaded properly
