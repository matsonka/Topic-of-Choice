First I need to download my genomes
  
  For my Neisseria meningitidis
  I went to the ENA website and found my data set and downloaded (bulk download files) the fastq files for my raw reads https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB9481
  
  Then after everything is downloaded I used WinSCP to move my folders (one for Nisseria and one for Moraxella of all of my raw reads into my scratch folder so that I can use it on the command line
  
  I was running out of room in my scratch folder so I used WinSCP to move everything to Dr.Techtmann's lab's server
  


Next I need to perform fastqc
performed fastqc for quality control on my raw reads
for example: fastqc ERR1124353_1.fastq.gz
I randomly selected just a few of my reads to look at the fastqc-did this for a select few of my reads for both the Nisseria and Moraxella reads


I didn't do quality trimming with cutadapt for all of my reads because from looking at the fastqc of my raw reads that I looked at I saw the reads are of good quality


aligned my reads using bowtie2
activate the RNASeq environment: ran command conda activate RNASeq

index the reference genome so that I can search it
bowtie2-build Moraxella Reference Genome.txt Moraxella
bowtie2-build Neisseria Reference Genome.txt Neisseria

map my reads to the indexed genome
bowtie2 -x Moraxella -1 ERR3410267_1.fastq.gz -2 ERR3410267_2.fastq.gz -S 1.sam
bowtie2 -x Neisseria -1 ERR3410267_1.fastq.gz -2 ERR3410267_2.fastq.gz -S 1.sam

For some of my mapping of my reads to the reference genome I was getting the following error:
"Error, fewer reads in the file specified with -1 than in file specified with -2
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'int'
(ERR): bowtie2-align died with signal 6 (ABRT) (core dumped)"

Some of the overall alignment rates for both Neisseria and Moraxella:

Variant Calling
Index the reference for variant calling
samtools faidx  Moraxella Reference Genome.txt

samtools faidx Neisseria Reference Genome.txt
Got the error "[E::fai_build3_core] Failed to open the file Neisseria
[faidx] Could not load fai index of Neisseria"

I tried downloading VEP and this did not work
Then I looked on the internet and realized that the the "fail to open the FASTA file" message almost certainly does simply mean that opening the Reference Genome.txt did not work

Since I copied my fasta into notepad I tried to find another way to get my fasta so I googled and found out that you can send the fasta to a file in genbank
I went back to the fasta in genbank. I copied the entire genome sequence, and then I clicked Send to-file-FASTA-and checked Show GI
Doing this downloaded the sequence into a file in my downloads. I then uploaded this file to WinSCP and ran the following commands:
"samtools faidx Neisseria Reference Sequence.fasta" this gave the error again of [E::fai_build3_core] Failed to open the file Neisseria
[faidx] Could not load fai index of Neisseria
So I tried to look at the head of the sequence by typing in the command ead Neisseria Reference Sequence.fasta
This gave the fllowing output:
head: cannot open 'Neisseria' for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open 'Reference' for reading: No such file or directory
head: cannot open 'Sequence.fasta' for reading: No such file or directory
Then I thought maybe I should just try renaming the file so that it was only one word with .fasta
So I renamed it Neisseria.fasta in WinSCP
Then in putty I put in the command head Neisseria.fasta, this gave me the output:
 >gi|610425456|gb|CP007524.1| Neisseria meningitidis strain 510612, complete genome

From here I was guessing it was working

Now I could move onto Indexing the reference for variant calling
samtools faidx Neisseria.fasta


Prepare Variant Calling on the .bam file
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.fasta 1.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (-using bcftools to take the reference and .bam file and map them together asking it to compile it and then call any variants that it finds)
(from this for 1.bam in Neisseria I see that the fasta sequence was not found)-we are outputting any variants that are different from our reference and our calls
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.fasta 2.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (from this for 2.bam in Neisseria I see that the fasta sequence was not found)
 This is not right. I didn't use the right fasta file for this-I needed the one that was used to align the data and has the reference sequence in it
So I tried to use the command
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria Reference Genome.txt 3.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (but this had the error [E::fai_build3_core] Failed to open the file Neisseria
Failed to open -: unknown file type")
To fix this I renamed my file Neisseria Reference Genome.txt to Neisseria.txt
Then I ran the command
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 3.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)

Now doing this for all of the files
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 1.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 2.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 4.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 5.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 6.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 7.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 8.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 9.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 10.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 11.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)
bcftools mpileup -f Neisseria.txt 12.bam | bcftools call -mv -Ob --ploidy 1 -o raw.calls.bcf (said [mpileup] 1 samples in 1 input files)


Filter the variant calls
bcftools filter --exclud 'QUAL < 30' raw.calls.bcf > calls.vcf (we do this to get rid of all of the questionable varaints so that we only end up with things that we are really confident about)
This filters out anything that has a quality of less than 30

Examine all of the variant calls
less calls.vcf (to get out of viewing press q for quit)
(from this command in 1.bam for Neisseria I saw that all filters passed and some of the variants are indels)

Extract the SNPs
bcftools view -v snps calls.vcf > snp.vcf (show me the SNPs, ignore insertions and deletions and I just want to see SNPs)
(labeled each one different for each .bam file, example for 1.bam labeled snp1.vcf)

the .vcf files are human readable



Make a Consensus fasta assembly
Zip the .vcf file
bgzip calls.vcf (labeled each one different for each .bam file, example for 1.bam labeled calls1.vcf)

Index the zipped .vcf.gz file
bcftools index calls.vcf.gz (labeled each one different for each .bam file, example for 1.bam labeled calls1.vcf.gz)


Make a consensus fasta file
cat Neisseria.fasta | bcftools consensus calls.vcf.gz > Neisseria_DSMZ.fasta (labeled each one different for each .bam file, example for 1.bam labeled Neisseria_DSMZ1.fasta)
(for 1.bam in Neisseria this gave me the warnings: 
Note: the --sample option not given, applying all records regardless of the genotype
Warning: Sequence "gi|610425456|gb|CP007524.1|" not in calls.vcf.gz)

The alignments and SNPs could then be visualized. I made another folder that shows that data







BLAST
Make a blastable database of protein sequences from the Neisseria protein sequences
makeblastdb -in Neisseria.fasta -dbtype prot -title Neissera_protein

Perform a blastp against the Neisseria protein db with the Moraxella.fasta as your query
blastp -db Neisseria.fasta -query Moraxella.fasta -out Moraxella_BLAST.txt -outfmt 7

this was not working, have to use NCBI BLAST
